# Entities

This library crate contains the entity definitions generated by `sea-orm cli`. SeaORM uses a schema first so we have to create/update our migrations first before generating the new entity definitions.

It generates the entity definitions by going through the database tables.

Before proceeding it is **important** that the `.env` file is defined.

To generate the entity definitions run the following command in the terminal:
```bash
sea-orm-cli generate entity -o entity/src/definitions
```

> Please don't make any other modifications to this module. It should be updated via the `sea-orm-cli` only.
